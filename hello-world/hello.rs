// A binary can be generated using the rust compiler: rustc
// $ rustc hello.rs
// A binary will be produced that can be executed with ./hello

// This is the main function:

fn main() {
    // statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called.

    // Print text to the console.

    println!("Hello world!");  // println! is a macro printing text to the console.
    println!("I'm a Rustacean!");
